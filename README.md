# CS50W – Project 0: Search

This is my implementation of CS50W’s Project 0.  
I rebuilt Google’s Search experience using only HTML and CSS, keeping the core structure but adding my own visual style and layout decisions.  

The project includes:
- Google Search
- Image Search
- Advanced Search
- I'm Feeling Lucky
- Responsive layout and custom styling

Feel free to check it out.
